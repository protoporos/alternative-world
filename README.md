# INTRODUCTION

This is an open project for people, who not only imagine a better world, but who are willing to create such a world. 
This world should meet all human needs while staying inside planetary boundaries. We are convinced that by creating such a new system, we can replace the old obsolete one, that since it started propagating from the west crushs the whole world.   

## CHARACTERISTICS
But what do we want to achieve with this project?
Let people live by the following principles:

- **living in communities**: not only is it closer to our human needs but also, a more efficient use of resources. This prerequisite of sharing an hibitation results in a number of other things that define how life looks like in this alternative world:
  - social intelligence: communication has to be better than in this world for it to work, since a lot of trust in one another is definitely necessary.
  - How to organise such a community is open for discussion :)
- **independence of economic growth**: this community should drive whether or not the economic grows, which means it should have a certain degree of self-sufficiency.
- **a regenerative system**: is sustainable since it only takes as much as the environment can give. There is no burning of fossil fuel and polluting the atmosphere because this would be a burden to earth - our live support system. Rather humans in this world use renewable sources to sustain themselves and are a part of ecosystems, actively supporting biodiversity.
- **a distributive world**: This world ends inequality by designing it, to make it impossible to amass ridicules amounts of wealth and power. Such an equal society would also end discrimination since everyone can live in abundancy. And it would be the most natural thing to let all knowledge be libre.
- **lastly, freedom:** members should never have to make a commitment to the live in this community, at all time they're free to opt out. And of course they have the freedom to decide what to think and what to do at any moment. But compromises will have to be made.

The goal of this peoject should be to make these ideals a reality lived by a lot of people as fast as possible. Since the human made problems on this world are too pressing and urgent to solve, wasting another 5 years making no progress is intolerable. With other words from the latest IPCC report:
  > *Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.*

## REPO OVERVIEW

The repository hosts a number of different files with different duties. The file [nodes.md](https://github.com/protoporos/alternative-world/blob/main/nodes.md) 
lists nodes of such a system which already have been created by lovely people imagining a better world.  The markdown file named [Inspiration.md](Inspiration.md) lists a bunch of YouTube Videos that give an idea of what we want to create.
