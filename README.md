# INTRODUCTION

This is an open project for people, who not only imagine a better world, but who are willing to create such a world. 
This world should meet all human needs for everyone while staying inside planetary boundaries. We are convinced that by creating such a new system, to replace the old one since it will become needless.  
This system should be distributive by design which would result in a fair world, regenerative so it doesn't destroy our live support system - mother earth, 
and growth-agnostic, because we need humanity to thrive wheter or not the economy grows. 

The repository hosts a number of different files with different duties. The file [nodes.md](https://github.com/protoporos/alternative-world/blob/main/nodes.md) 
lists nodes of such a system which already have been created by lovely people imagining a better world.
